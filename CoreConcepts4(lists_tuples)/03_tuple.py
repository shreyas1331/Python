##Tuples are ordered collections of items that are immutable.They are similar to lists,but their immutability makes them different

# -what is immutable ----(Tuples are immutable, so you cannot modify the elements once they are created. Tuples cannot be sorted in place like lists)




a = (1,45,342,3424,False, "Rohan", "Shivam")
print(a)
print(type(a))

# if only 1 element
a=(1,)  #like this

# tuple mai () ye brackets use krte hain      N O T E
# and list mai []
